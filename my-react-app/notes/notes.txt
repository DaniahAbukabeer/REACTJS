JSX = javascript xml
allows u to write html like code for interface 
reduces rendinring time bc it only re-renders changes on the dom and not everything

js requirements
arrays
classes
objects
arrow functions


if the dev enviroment is closed and you want to restart it
use terminal 
cd to ur project folder
npm run dev 
to start the dev server and then refresh the web page!!

assets folder is v similar to the public folder
but files for assets are bundled during the final output but public assets are not!!
and are avilable via a url


the app.jsx is a component that we import into the main.jsx
components can have a dedicated css style sheet

react elements are only capable of returning one component but that component can have childeredn within it!!


when we want to return more than one component we use someting called a fragment
where its just an empty set of angled brakets


a component is a small section of code that can include js and html , the function will return the code and make it re-usable!!

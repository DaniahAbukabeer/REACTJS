how we can update the state of an array using react!!!!


import React,{useState} from "react";

function MyArrayState(){

    const [foods, setFoods] = useState(["Apple","Orange","Banana"]);

    function handleAddFood(){}

    function handleRemoveFood(){}

    return(<div>
            <h2>List of Food</h2>
            <ul>
                {foods.map((food, index)=><li></li>)}
            </ul>
    </div>);

}

export default MyArrayState

if we have this as an example, notice how if we run the code as is, the foods array
has three initial values
so when we run the code,
it creates three empty li elements because we are maping through foods array and it has three elements

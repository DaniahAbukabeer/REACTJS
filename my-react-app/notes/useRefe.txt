//useState() => re-renders the componetn when the state value changes

but we dont always want to do this,

so we have useRef() = "use Refrence" does not cause a re-render when its values changes. 
when yopu want a componet to  "remember" some information,
but you dont want that information to trigger new renders.


1. accessing/Interaction with DOM elements
2. Handling Foucs, Animations, and transitions
3. Managing Timers and Intervals


to use it we have to import it from react




ex. we are working on this code that uses useState

import React, {useState,useEffect,useRef} from 'react'

export default function TryingUseRef() {

    let [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

    useEffect(()=>{
        console.log("COMPONENT RENDERED");
    });

    function handleClick(){
        setNumber(n => n +1);
    }
  return (
    <div>
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Click me
        </button>
    </div>
  )
}


this would cause the page to re-render every time we click the button which will pring ont he console comopnent rerendered everytiem
we hit the button!!

but instead if we used useRef

useRef returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to the initial value you provided.

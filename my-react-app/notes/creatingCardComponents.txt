NOTES FROM REACT FULL COURSE FOR FREE CRASH COURSE BY BRO CODE ON YOUTUBE

to set style we need to give the html elements a class right?\
but you cant use class bc its a reserved word for jsx
instead use className!


note!!
if theres an error with ur code nothing will rended on the screan, use inspect on hte browser if u r not getting any syntax errors!!

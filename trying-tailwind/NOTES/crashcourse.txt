in the tailwind.config.js file we can set a theme for the project, for example 
withing the theme:{

} we can set the screens breakpoint so the app is responsive
and would work nicely on diffrent screen size devices!


so we can do something like this
  theme: {
    screens: {
      sm: '480px',
      md: '768px',
      lg: '976px',
      xl: '1440px'
    },
    extend: {},
  },

now lets say we want to set the colors for the project

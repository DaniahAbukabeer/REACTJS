redux complete tutorial notes
video by cosden solutions guy on youtube!!


redux is a state managment library that allows to have golbae state
so we can have access to any component no matter where they are in the tree

three difrent consepts 

//STORE
which is the globale state that is goning to be accessible across any component
no matter where they are in the react application


the store you get do defin it completely how we want
and connect it to my react application
the store is ususally made up of multiple slices
multiple slices of the state each responsible for a certain
domain in the application 

for example
interface CounterState {
    value: number;
}

interface UserState{
    isSignedIn: boolean;
}

//ACTIONS
essentially what it does is it tells redux what it should do with
to the state
(actions have two properties that are super super important)
 

 const increment = {
    type: "INCREMENT",
    payload: 1
 };
  const decrement = {
    type: "INCREMENT",
    payload: 1
 };

 the type is always gonna be of type string and its is required,  
 essentially its the name of this action 
 redux is going to use this type to determine what it shold

if we are making action increment or decrement, we dont really need to pass a payload
bc the default for increment and decrement is by 1

but if we do something like this
const incrementByAmount = {
    type: "INCREMENT", 
    playload: 10,
}



//REDUCERS
are responsible for taking an action and then depending on the type of the action
woudl go out and make the updated using the redux store,

reducers never directly make an update to the redux store, 
we have this concept of immutablitiy which means that we re never allowed to directly mutate the state
instead istead what reducers are going to do is they're going to take 
the state they're going to make a copy of the state and then make those changes
to that copy of the state which will have all the other unchange properties of the state
will completely replace the state as a whole with the copy that has the changes
applayed!!!!
 

 react on default cannot talk to redux we have to use a provider from react reduct 
 to connect our store and our entire redux application 


 got to main.jsx / main.tsx which is basically where we are 
 rendering the entire app and then im going to import a provider



 slices in redux, particulary when used in redux toolkit serves a few important purposese:

 1.encapsulation of logic =>> slices allow you to encapsulate related redux logic into a single module.
 this would include defining reducesr, action creators and initial state for a specific feature or part of your application state


2.reduction of bolierplate ==> redux traditionally involves writing a lot of bolierplate code
for defining action types, action creators and reducers. slices reduce this bolierplate significantly by providing a concise API ('createslice' function from redux toolkit)
for defining all of these together

3. modularity and reusabliity

4. imporved tooling and dev experience
